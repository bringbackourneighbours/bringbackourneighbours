## Information

As part of the campaign “Bring Back Our Neighbours” we, a group of full-time and honorary activists in the fields of Asylum and political education in Saxony, created numerous info flyers and this First Aid Kit against deportation.

This is intended to provide people who fear deportation, voluntary supporters, and professionals with a simple introduction, a quick overview, and further information on the topic of deportation.

We fundamentally reject deportation as inhumane; they represent racism and nationalism.

We criticize the violent action of deportations in Saxony, which endangers people’s lives and health.

We want to protect as many people as possible from this violence.

Often the knowledge on how to protect people from deportation is missing. We want to impart this knowledge here.

Dabei haben wir keinen Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit. Wir bemühen uns um stetige Aktualisierung und Berichtigung.

We have no claim to completeness. We strive for constant updating and correction.

The flyers and the First Aid Kit do not replace consulting.
