## What to do if there is a risk of deportation?

Deportation can happen at any time. The fear of it and the deportation itself are extremely stressful.

Please take the risk of deportation seriously: Even if nothing has happened to you for many years and friends of yours are not deported, it can happen.

There is a lot of practical knowledge in your community - use it! But there are also many false rumours! And every case is different. Employees in the authorities have a lot of decision-making power. What has worked for acquaintances does not necessarily work for you.

If you have a tolerated stay permit (Duldung), check carefully whether you have any options for obtaining a residence permit (Aufenthalts-Titel). You can get support from an advice centre, for example.

The task of the immigration authorities is to deport people with tolerated status. So be careful and don't trust what employees tell you. Ask for written confirmation of everything they say! If you feel unsure, ask supporters to accompany you to the immigration office (Ausländer-Behörde).

Talk little but politely to the employees. Only give them important information with written proof. For example: employment contract, training contract, maternity pass, medical certificate. It is not enough if you tell the employees.

Here you can listen to information in various languages about your rights with the authorities:

## How do I protect myself from deportation?

The aim is always to prevent deportation. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. If deportation does happen, it is helpful to have important things prepared so that you don't forget them in the rush.

## How can I prepare for deportation?

After you have dealt with this, meet up with loved ones and do something nice.

It's important to recognise the risk of deportation and prepare well. But don't let the fear get you down!

## The deportation is ongoing - what can I do?

The police are responsible for deportation

It is best to read the following information at your leisure if you fear deportation. You don't have time for this during deportation.

## What does deportation custody mean? (Abschiebehaft)

If the immigration authorities want to deport you, they can take you into custody.
