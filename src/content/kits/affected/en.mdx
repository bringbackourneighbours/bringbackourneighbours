## Asylum procedure and Dublin

Many people who are later threatened with deportation come to Germany as asylum seekers. The asylum procedure is complicated and takes away many of your rights. The better you know, the better you can defend yourself, here you will find important information:

If you apply for asylum in Germany, Germany will first check whether another country in Europe is responsible. This is called the Dublin procedure. You can find information here:

## What is a deportation?

Deportation means that people have to leave Germany against their will.

The police collect people for deportation.

Deportations must be announced in a letter. But this letter may have been sent many years ago. It is usually the negative decision from the BAMF. This is the letter in which the asylum application is rejected. The letter also states the country to which you are to be deported.

## When am I at risk for deportation?

If you do not have a valid residence permit in Germany, you are at risk of deportation. This is often the case after a negative decision in the asylum procedure.

After a negative decision in the asylum procedure, many people nevertheless remain in Germany for a long time and receive a tolerated stay (Duldung). Unfortunately, deportation is possible even after a long time in Germany.

</FlyerBox>

Over 200,000 people have a tolerated stay (Duldung) in Germany in 2024. Just over half of these people had previously applied for asylum, which was rejected. The others are, for example, foreign students, workers or tourists whose visa has expired or people who have lost another residence permit.

Tolerated persons are ‘obliged to leave the country’, they theoretically have to leave and can be deported. However, due to many complicated regulations, only just under 50,000 people are actually obliged to leave the country. Less than half of these people are deported each year.

## What to do if there is a risk of deportation?

Deportation can happen at any time. The fear of it and the deportation itself are extremely stressful.

Please take the risk of deportation seriously: Even if nothing has happened to you for many years and friends of yours are not deported, it can happen.

There is a lot of practical knowledge in your community - use it! But there are also many false rumours! And every case is different. Employees in the authorities have a lot of decision-making power. What has worked for acquaintances does not necessarily work for you.

If you have a tolerated stay permit (Duldung), check carefully whether you have any options for obtaining a residence permit (Aufenthalts-Titel). You can get support from an advice centre, for example.

The task of the immigration authorities is to deport people with tolerated status. So be careful and don't trust what employees tell you. Ask for written confirmation of everything they say! If you feel unsure, ask supporters to accompany you to the immigration office (Ausländer-Behörde).

Talk little but politely to the employees. Only give them important information with written proof. For example: employment contract, training contract, maternity pass, medical certificate. It is not enough if you tell the employees.

Here you can listen to information in various languages about your rights with the authorities:

## How do I protect myself from deportation?

The aim is always to prevent deportation. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. If deportation does happen, it is helpful to have important things prepared so that you don't forget them in the rush.

## How can I prepare for deportation?

</FlyerBox>

After you have dealt with this, meet up with loved ones and do something nice.

It's important to recognise the risk of deportation and prepare well. But don't let the fear get you down!

## The deportation is ongoing - what can I do?

The police are responsible for deportation

It is best to read the following information at your leisure if you fear deportation. You don't have time for this during deportation.

## What does deportation custody mean? (Abschiebehaft)

If the immigration authorities want to deport you, they can take you into custody.
