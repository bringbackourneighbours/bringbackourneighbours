## Important information:

We have compiled templates that can be used in an emergency, i.e. in the event of an ongoing deportation. However, we strongly recommend that applications and powers of attorney are drawn up by lawyers or advice centres in relation to the specific individual case. The templates are only available in German.

## Objection to the search of your home

During deportations, the police may only enter and not search the homes of those affected. The room of a collective accommodation centre is also considered a home. If police officers want to search a person's home, they need a search warrant from a judge, which they usually do not have. They can search a home without a warrant if there is ‘imminent danger’, for example if someone has a weapon and is threatening to commit suicide.

## Urgent application

An urgent appeal can be lodged with the administrative court against an ongoing deportation. This should definitely be done by the responsible lawyer! This template should only be used if there is no other option. It must be faxed to the administrative court, and it is best to telephone the court and the authorities involved, i.e. the regional court and the federal police, to inform them that an urgent appeal has been filed and that a deportation may have to be cancelled. An annex to the urgent application is also required, which must be written individually for the person/family concerned. This should explain in detail the reasons that speak against deportation. For example, a serious illness or a right to stay (e.g. education, sustainable integration) or that the family will be separated for a longer period of time, etc. As far as possible, these reasons should also be proven.

## Power of attorney

At best, lawyers or counselling centres are authorised. In an emergency, you can authorise a supporter or social worker. The power of attorney can help them to submit applications, speak to lawyers and authorities, or clarify urgent matters if the person concerned has already been picked up by the police or deported. Please discuss the scope of powers of attorney carefully and use them responsibly, authorising as much as necessary but as little as possible

## Follow-up application for asylum

This follow-up application should only be used if there is no lawyer or counselling centre. It must be signed by the person and faxed to the BAMF. Fax it to the branch office of the BAMF in your place of residence and to the centre. Then inform a deportation monitoring centre and the Federal Police at the airport that a follow-up application has been submitted. The deportation may not start until the BAMF responds to this application. This is usually done by e-mail or telephone directly to the Federal Police.

## Person of trust for detention pending deportation

Persons affected by detention pending deportation can appoint a so-called person of trust in addition to or instead of a lawyer. The person of trust supports the person who is often unable to organise much in the deportation prison themselves. They can also lodge complaints against the detention centre on behalf of those affected and inspect files. The deportation detention contact group in Dresden provides voluntary counselling in deportation detention and is happy to provide support.
