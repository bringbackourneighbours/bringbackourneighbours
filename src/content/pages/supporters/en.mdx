>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic of counselling

Every case is different and asylum and residence law is very complex and changes frequently. Please do not try to help a person at risk of deportation on your own. There are free advice centres and lawyers who are well versed in migration law. You can be an important bridge here, accompanying them to appointments and helping to collect all the documents etc.


>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic of ongoing deportation

Deportation is traumatic and often cannot be interrupted. It is worth a try.
Counsellors and witnesses are always important. 
Try to stay calm.
Concentrate on those affected, what do they need from you right now? Stand by them and try to make contact with the police and any doctors present.
You can take on the tasks described above for those affected, e.g. collect information from the police, airport, etc., draw the attention of the police or a doctor to obstacles to deportation and insist that they are taken seriously, call the lawyer, secretly make video recordings, fax away applications, etc. 

If possible, you and others can organise a blockade together, in front of the house, the bus, the police station or the airport on a regular scheduled flight. In the case of collective deportations, a very large blockade of an airport gate or an extra area would probably have to be organised. Blockaders face criminal charges, so they run a criminal risk. 
local groups e.g. "Rote Hilfe" or "Ermittlungsausschuss" can provide support here.

Try to establish contact with those affected after a deportation has been completed. Perhaps you can help with the most urgent needs? (e.g. money, keeping in touch with lawyers, etc.)

Deportations can also be traumatising for those providing support. Especially if they themselves are threatened with deportation. Unfortunately, many deportations can no longer be stopped. It's not your fault if it doesn't work out. Talk to others about your experiences, it can help.

Because it is very difficult to fight against deportation alone, it is best to have several supporters and good contacts to NGOs, advice centres and the media. So get organised and network!
