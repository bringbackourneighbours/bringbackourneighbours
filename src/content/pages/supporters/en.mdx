>> BLOCK: Additional information for volunteer supporters

This emergency kit is not only for those affected but also for volunteer supporters: Friends, neighbours, teachers, colleagues or other volunteers. 
They should be able to recognise the risk of deportation and help with an ongoing deportation. 
The emergency kit contains many practical tips, useful contacts and tips for public protest against deportations.
The information is aimed linguistically at those affected, e.g. ‘When is my deportation imminent’ or ‘When you apply for asylum’ - this always addresses people who are personally at risk of deportation. 


>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic of counselling

Every case is different and asylum and residence law is very complex and changes frequently. Please do not try to help a person at risk of deportation on your own. There are free advice centres and lawyers who are well versed in migration law. You can be an important bridge here, accompanying them to appointments and helping to collect all the documents etc.

>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic of asylum procedures

You can help a person in the asylum procedure to ensure that they receive all letters safely. Every new address, including a redistribution by the authorities, must be reported to the BAMF. An email with the name, date of birth, old and new address and the BAMF reference number to service@bamf.bund.de is sufficient. You can empty the letterbox if the person is not there. You can remind the person of important appointments and help prepare for the hearing. You can also attend the hearing as a counsellor.

>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic of imminent deportation

As a supporter, there are a variety of specific support options if you are at risk of deportation.
Discuss all options and your role with those affected. Be careful not to ‘run over’ or restrict those affected. Try to inform yourself and those affected sufficiently and then accept their decision.
But also be aware of your resources and be transparent about how, where and to what extent you want to provide support.

>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic of stress caused by the risk of deportation

The psychological and physical stress caused by the threat of deportation is very great, often invisible and underestimated. They also manifest themselves, for example, in absent-mindedness, forgotten appointments, withdrawal into private life, suppression of the risk of deportation, apathy or aggression. Please do not judge such behaviour too quickly, but ask if and how you can help. 

>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the right to stay

You can help with the right to stay in a variety of ways: practise German and improve your language skills, help with studying for the ‘Living in Germany’ orientation course test, find an apprenticeship or job, obtain letters of support (hardship application), help with access to medical treatment or circulate a petition. Advice centres can support you and give you further tips. Help to collect evidence for a right to stay or that deportation is impossible as quickly as possible. This could be, for example: Proof of illness, inability to travel, pregnancy, training place, job, wedding, etc.

>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic: Preparing for deportation

Perhaps you can be this trusted person who can be called in an emergency and who has prepared powers of attorney or urgent applications ready. But don't impose yourself here and only take on this role if you can probably fulfil it.  Perhaps you can already organise people who can be reached quickly in an emergency for a blockade. 
Preparing for deportation can be extremely stressful, inform those affected about this possibility and offer your support, but do not persuade or pressure them to do so.

>> BLOCK: Additional information for supporters on the topic of ongoing deportation

Deportation is traumatic and often cannot be interrupted. It is worth a try.
Counsellors and witnesses are always important. 
Try to stay calm.
Concentrate on those affected, what do they need from you right now? Stand by them and try to make contact with the police and any doctors present.
You can take on the tasks described above for those affected, e.g. collect information from the police, airport, etc., draw the attention of the police or a doctor to obstacles to deportation and insist that they are taken seriously, call the lawyer, secretly make video recordings, fax away applications, etc. 

If possible, you and others can organise a blockade together, in front of the house, the bus, the police station or the airport on a regular scheduled flight. In the case of collective deportations, a very large blockade of an airport gate or an extra area would probably have to be organised. Blockaders face criminal charges, so they run a criminal risk. 
local groups e.g. "Rote Hilfe" or "Ermittlungsausschuss" can provide support here.

Try to establish contact with those affected after a deportation has been completed. Perhaps you can help with the most urgent needs? (e.g. money, keeping in touch with lawyers, etc.)

Deportations can also be traumatising for those providing support. Especially if they themselves are threatened with deportation. Unfortunately, many deportations can no longer be stopped. It's not your fault if it doesn't work out. Talk to others about your experiences, it can help.

Because it is very difficult to fight against deportation alone, it is best to have several supporters and good contacts to NGOs, advice centres and the media. So get organised and network!
