### Deportation monitoring centres ("Abschiebebeobachtungsstellen")

The aim of independent deportation monitoring is to identify structural abuses and contribute to the protection of fundamental and human rights. For example, they observe whether the means used by the police are appropriate to the situation. Deportation observers are not allowed to intervene.

### Federal police at the airports

If there are decisions that prevent deportation at short notice (see flyer <InternalShortLink identifier="ongoing-deportation">Ongoing deportation</InternalShortLink> ), the Federal Police at the airport must be informed at short notice by lawyers or supporters.

### Contacts to authorities and courts

<Block identifier="fax" />

### Contacts to the Saxon deportation authority (Landesdirektion Sachsen, LDS)

This authority organises most deportations from Saxony. 
These are important numbers to negotiate a deportation stop or to pass on important urgent information.
Don't be intimidated and insist on your rights!

<Address identifier="lds" />

You can find contacts for other federal states online by entering ‘Zentrale Ausländerbehörde + dein Bundesland’ in search engines.

### Contacts to courts

Urgent applications against deportations are sent to the administrative courts. The competent administrative court depends on your address:
<Address identifier="vg_chemnitz" />
<Address identifier="vg_dresden" />
<Address identifier="vg_leipzig" />

You can find contacts for other federal states online by entering ‘Verwaltungsgericht + place of residence of the person concerned’ in search engines (e.g. Google).

### Contact to BAMF - Federal Office for Migration and Refugees

Together with the immigration authorities, the BAMF organises Dublin deportations, i.e. deportations to other countries in the European Union and to Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Legal reasons against a Dublin deportation should be sent to the BAMF. Follow-up asylum applications can also stop deportations. They must also be faxed to the BAMF.
<Address identifier="bamf-dd" />
<Address identifier="bamf-le" />
<Address identifier="bamf-ch" />
If you are not sure which branch office is responsible and for applications from a prison, contact the BAMF centre:
<Address identifier="bamf-allg" />

### Contacts in politics

In specific cases, it can be helpful to contact responsible actors in order to exert pressure or receive support to stop the deportation.

- Prime Minister of the federal state ("Ministerpräsident")
- Ministry of the Interior of the federal state, possibly Department for Foreigners' Affairs ("Innenministerium")
- Ministry of Social Affairs / Integration Commissioner / Commissioner for Foreigners in your federal state / district ("Sozialministerium", "Integrationsbeauftragte", "Ausländerbeauftragte")
- Lord mayor of the independent cities or district councillors of the districts and head of the municipal foreigners authority: you can find the contacts online on the homepage of the city / district ("Oberbürgermeisterin", "Landrat")
- Members of the state parliament, state parliament or Bundestag ("Landtagsabgeordnete", Bundestagsabgeordnete")

On abgeordnetenwatch.de you can find the responsible people by selecting the postcode and parliament.
<ExternalShortLink identifier="abgeordnetenwatch" />

### International contacts

It is often not possible to prevent an ongoing deportation. Those affected then also need support in the country in which they arrive.
You can find contacts to specialised lawyers, NGOs and other support structures in other European countries under the following links:
<ExternalShortLink identifier="w2eu_contacts" />

<ExternalShortLink identifier="elena" />

For contacts outside Europe, you can, for example, search on the respective embassy website of the country or ask migrant self-organisations from these countries.
You can also find information and contacts for almost all countries on the IOM's return counselling service (ZIRF country information):
<ExternalShortLink identifier="return" />

Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that all contacts are reliable and will be able to help.

### Contacts in authorities and politics (actors responsible for deportations)
