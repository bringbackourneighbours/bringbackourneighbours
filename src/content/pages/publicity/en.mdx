As an appendix to the ‘Emergency kit against deportations’, we have collected tips on how supporters and professionals can ensure more publicity and thus support against an ongoing or already completed deportation.
We have evaluated the ‘Bring Back Our Neighbours’ 2021 campaign in Pirna, but also some other successful and above all loud protests against deportations in Saxony. However, we are always happy to receive further information and tips by email to: info@bringbackourneighbours.de

- There are support structures that can help to create a more critical public opinion on deportations. The attitude and participation of those affected and how active the wider support group is are crucial.
- First and foremost, it is necessary that those affected agree whether and how much (e.g. anonymously / private photos etc.) the public may learn about their deportation and their lives. They should always be involved and release information, pictures etc. or nominate a trusted person who can decide on the release.
- The circle of support (e.g. family, friends, neighbours, colleagues) needs a lot of commitment, time and flexibility on the day of deportation and for a few days/weeks.
- It is possible to stop the deportation by quickly organising a blockade in front of the flat, house, bus, etc. However, experience has shown that the police are very brutal in their approach, and the blockaders can also face criminal charges.
- In the case of an ongoing deportation, there is a small window of a few hours (pick-up of the person concerned until departure) in which the deportation can be prevented if necessary, for example through a successful urgent application to the court, through the hardship commission or a decision by the state directorate.
- The following information relates more to public relations work in the event of detention in a deportation centre, imminent deportation or after deportation.
- Public relations work should be started as soon as possible.
- There are many different ways of expressing protest against a deportation and creating publicity, from demonstrations, graffiti, solidarity parties, flyer campaigns, emails, letters, petitions, fundraising, newspaper articles, radio interviews and much more.
- However, this form of public relations work and protest should take place in addition to legal steps (urgent application etc.) and, if necessary, the hardship commission and should not replace them.

## Forms of protest and public relations work

- Demonstrations and rallies: Organise spontaneously or register with the city
- Start petitions, e.g. as an online petition or addressed to the city / state parliament
- Write an open letter and collect signatures, e.g. to mayors or district councillors
- Use public space with graffiti, flyers, stickers and / or posters
- Write letters / emails to those responsible and supporters
- Press work: contact journalists, summarise the most important information in press releases >> Also contact the Saxon Refugee Council: pr@sfrev.de
- Collect donations for lawyers' fees, living expenses in the country of destination of the deportation
- Bundle information and keep the public up to date through websites and/or social media channels and hashtags
- Use messenger services (Telegram, Signal, Whats App...) to inform all networks about the deportation and the protest against it

## Content of protest and public relations work

- As this involves very private information, public relations work must be coordinated with those affected!
- What was particularly scandalous about the deportation?
- Deportation from home, e.g. after years of residence, school and work, friends, voluntary work, deportation shortly before residence permit, etc.
- Particularly brutal deportation due to shackling, family separation, endangerment of children's welfare, despite the presence of mental illness, etc.
- Life-threatening deportation, e.g. in the event of particular danger in the country of destination of the deportation, illness, high-risk pregnancy, etc.
- Draw a personal portrait of the person concerned: Reason for fleeing, life in Germany, everyday life, hobbies, involvement in clubs etc., relationships with supporters, dreams for the future
- Illustration through photos, audios, videos, quotes, letters, drawings by those affected
- Insights into deportation: audio or video recordings, witness statements

## Contact the responsible persons

Politicians should take a closer look at the reality of deportations. In most cases, there are only loud and inflammatory calls for more deportations. What it really means and the fact that many people in Germany take a critical view of deportations is often overlooked. 
Many angry, sad, demanding letters/emails/calls to ministries and authorities can certainly have an effect. Politicians and government officials learn that there is a critical public and that those affected have great support. In individual cases, these contacts can even be used to stop a deportation.
