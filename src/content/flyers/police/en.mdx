The police can pick you up for deportation in many places:

- in your flat, room or accommodation
- at an appointment with the authorities
- at work or on the way there
- sometimes also at the homes of friends or family members
- on the street during spontaneous police checks.

All addresses that an authority (social welfare office, immigration office, BAMF, town hall) knows are potentially dangerous.

The police can come at any time of the day, usually very early in the morning. Deportation can often no longer be prevented. You only have a few hours before you are deported by plane.

## Police outside the flat?

Keep calm! If you are the person who is to be deported, don't open the door if you don't want to be deported! Be very calm and leave the lights off.

Are you with friends or family members who are not in danger of deportation? Let them do that:

- Don't open the door. Try to speak to the person over the loudspeaker.
- Inform friends or a lawyer.
- Ask if the police have an arrest warrant.
- If the police do not have a warrant, they should not enter. Say this clearly but calmly.
- Try to record the police secretly, for example as a voice message or record on your mobile phone.
- The police will still try to enter the flat. They will tell you that they are just ‘looking around’ ["Betreten"], but do not ‘search’ your belongings ["Durchsuchen"].
- If the police insist that entering the flat is legal, then they are half right. To avoid escalation, let them enter, but complain verbally ["Widerspruch"].
- If the police insist that entering the flat is legal, then they are half right. To avoid escalation, let them enter, but complain verbally ["Widerspruch"].
- Accompany the police officers into every room and try to memorise everything: How many are there? What do they say? What are they doing? Ask for the name of the person in charge of the operation.

## What to do afterwards?

- Write down what happened immediately afterwards. Describe it as precisely as possible. You can also record it as a voice message.
- Please also contact the deportation monitoring centre of the Saxon Refugee Council: <Address identifier="sfr_abschiebemonitoring"></Address>
- Talk to a lawyer or a counselling centre about whether you can make a written objection to the search and file a complaint.

## Police in the accommodation / camp?

Preparation counts!

- Find out who has received a negative decision from the BAMF and is at risk of deportation.
- Where are good hiding places in the camp that you can get to quickly?
- Which social workers are good and can help? Talk to them!
- Keep up to date with deportation dates! That way you know when the police might enter the camp. Information on X, Instagram, Facebook or Telegram: <Address identifier="deportationalarm"></Address>

When the police enter the camp, those who are threatened with deportation should hide. Those who are not threatened can offer protection.

You should organise this in advance. Talk to the people in your accommodation. Many are afraid or worried about their own asylum procedure, but together you can prevent deportations.

- People who are not threatened with deportation can hide others. Many people could swap rooms.
- You can gather at the entrance during deportations to cause a disturbance and distract the police.
- You can warn each other with whistles.

The police also want to look for people in other rooms where they don't live! If they come into your room looking for someone else, object clearly but calmly. The police are allowed to ‘enter’ your room, but not to search it. They are not allowed to look in cupboards or under the bed.

Inform others about deportations and the behaviour of the police! Try to secretly make videos or audio recordings. Observe closely and write everything down afterwards

## The police will pick you up from work:

- The police need a search warrant for the office or company premises.
- Ask your boss or supervisor to request this warrant from the police.
- You can explain to your colleagues that the police are not arresting you for a criminal offence, but that the police are often so forceful when it comes to deportations.
- Insist that you call your lawyer or supporter. Perhaps colleagues or superiors can also support you.
- If your work can be a reason for a right to stay, ask your colleagues to send your employment contract and a current payslip and a letter of support to your lawyer or a supporter.

## The police will pick you up from the authorities or at a roadside checkpoint:

- Officials or people on the street are unlikely to help you.
- Here too, you have the right to call your lawyer or other supporters.
- If the risk of deportation is high, always take a friend or supporter with you and do not travel alone. They can check for you outside the immigration office and in the clerk's room to see if the police are there and warn you secretly.
- If you can't go to an appointment with an authority, you must cancel it. The best way to do this is to write an email to the authority on the day of the appointment. You should have an important reason (e.g. illness) and send proof (e.g. sick note from the doctor).
- If you miss the appointment, the authorities can report you as a ‘fugitive’ and put you on the wanted list. This means that the police can arrest you anywhere and you can also be taken into custody pending deportation more easily.
- Appointments with the police themselves (as a witness or accused person) can also be used for deportation.
- If the police recognise you on the street, they can also take you away. If you are wanted for deportation, the police can arrest you.
