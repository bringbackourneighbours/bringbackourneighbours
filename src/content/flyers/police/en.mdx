The police are responsible for deportations. They pick up the people who are to be deported from their homes or in the camp. They can come at any time of day, usually very early in the morning. In most cases, deportation can then no longer be prevented. That is why, it is important to apply for a right to stay at an early stage and not to wait with a tolerated stay \[Duldung\].

In the emergency booklet against deportation (“Notfallkoffer gegen Abschiebung”), we provide more detailed information on what you can do against deportation:

## Police outside your home?

Keep calm! If you are the person who is to be deported, do not open the door!

If you are not the person who is to be deported:

- Do not open the door. Try to speak to the person over the loudspeaker.
- Inform friends or a lawyer.
- Ask if the police have an arrest warrant.
- If the police do not have a warrant, they should not enter. Say this clearly but calmly.
- Attempt to record the police secretly, for example as a voice message.
- The police will still try to enter your home. They will tell you that they are just "looking around" \[Enter\], but not "search" your belongings.
- If the police insist that entering the flat is legal, then they are half right. To avoid escalation, let them enter, but complain verbally \["objection"\ "Widerspruch"\ ].
- If you live in a shared flat, keep the doors of your flatmates closed. The police have no access!
- Accompany the police officers into every room and try to memorise everything: How many are there? What do they say? What do they do? Ask for the name of the person in charge of the operation.

## What is to be done afterwards?

- Write down what happened immediately afterwards. Describe it as precisely as possible. You can also record it as a voice message.
- Please also contact the deportation monitoring centre of the Saxon Refugee Council: <Address identifier="sfr_abschiebemonitoring"></Address>
- Talk to a lawyer or a counselling centre, whether you can make a written objection to the search and file a complaint.

## Police in the camp?

Preparation counts!

- Find out who has received a negative decision from the BAMF and is at risk of deportation
- Where are there good hiding places in the camp that you can get to quickly?
- Which social workers are good and can help? Talk to them!
- Keep up to date with deportation dates! That way you know when the police might enter the camp. Information is available on ️X, Instagram, Facebook or Telegram <Address identifier="deportationalarm"></Address>
- When the police enter the camp, those who are threatened with deportation should hide. Those who are not threatened can offer protection.
- For example by: Hiding. Or by gathering in a large crowd and filming the police. Or using whistles to warn others.
- The police also want to look for people in other rooms where they don't live! If they come into your room looking for someone else, object clearly but calmly. The police may "enter" your room, but not search it. They are not allowed to look in cupboards or under the bed.
- Inform others about deportations and the behaviour of the police! Try to collect evidence secretly (videos, audio recordings). Observe closely and then write everything down
- Please also report everything to the deportation monitoring centre of the Saxon Refugee Council: <Address identifier="sfr_abschiebemonitoring"></Address>
