The police can pick you up for deportation in many places, for example from your home, at an appointment with the authorities, at work or on the street. 
The police sometimes also try to pick you up from family or friends if they know your address.
This is because all addresses that an authority (social welfare office, immigration office, BAMF, town hall) knows are potentially dangerous. 
The police can come at any time of day, usually very early in the morning. It is often no longer possible to prevent deportation. 
You only have a few hours before you are deported by plane.

## Police outside the flat?

Keep calm! If you are the person who is to be deported, don't open the door if you don't want to be deported! Be very calm and switch off the light.

If there are other people with you who are not in danger of being deported, they should not open the door either. 
They should talk to the police over the loudspeaker. 
It is best to inform friends or a lawyer as soon as possible.
If other people speak to the police on your behalf, they should ask whether the police have an arrest warrant.
If the police don't have one, the police officers are not allowed to enter. You have to say this clearly but calmly.
You can try to record the police __secretly__, for example as a voice message or audio recording on your mobile phone.
The police will still try to enter the flat. They will say that they are just "looking around" and "enter" ("Betreten"), but not "search" ("Durchsuchen") the flat.
Unfortunately, this is a bit complicated legally. To avoid escalation, you may have to let the police into the flat, but your supporters should make it clear that they do not agree. The police may then only enter the hallway or perhaps look into some rooms, but they are not allowed to actively search for the person they are supposed to deport.
If the police are in a shared flat, the flatmates' rooms may be locked. The police have no access!
Your supporters should ask for the name of the person in charge of the operation. They should always accompany the police officers and remember everything exactly: How many are there? What are they saying? What are they doing? 

When the police have left, you should make a "memory log" and immediately write down everything that happened. You can also record a voice message.
Talk to a lawyer or a counselling centre about whether you or the other tenants of the flat can make a written objection to the search and sue the police.

## Police in the accommodation / camp?

Preparation counts!

- Find out who has received a negative decision from the BAMF and is at risk of deportation.
- Where are good hiding places in the camp that you can get to quickly?
- Which social workers are good and can help? Talk to them!
- Keep up to date with deportation dates! This way you know when the police might enter the camp. Information is available on X, Instagram, Facebook or Telegram, for example: <address identifier="deportationalarm"></address>
- When the police enter the camp, those who are threatened with deportation should hide. Those who are not threatened can offer protection.
- You should organise this in advance. Talk to the people in your accommodation. Many are afraid or worried about their own asylum procedure, but together you can prevent deportations: People who are not at risk of deportation can hide others. Many people could swap rooms. You can gather at the entrance during deportations to cause a disturbance and distract the police. You can warn each other with whistles.
- The police also want to look for people in other rooms where they don't live! If they come into your room looking for someone else, object clearly but calmly. The police may "enter" ("Betreten") your room, but not "search" ("Durchsuchen" it. They are not allowed to look in cupboards.
- Inform others about deportations and the behaviour of the police! Try to secretly make videos or audio recordings. Observe closely and write everything down afterwards

## The police pick you up from work:

- The police need a search warrant for the office or company premises.
- Ask your boss or supervisor to request this warrant from the police.
- You can explain to your colleagues that the police are not arresting you for a criminal offence, but that the police are often so forceful when it comes to deportations.
- If your work can be a reason for a right to stay, ask your colleagues to email your employment contract, a current payslip or a letter of support to your lawyer or a supporter.

## The police will pick you up from the authorities or at a roadside checkpoint:

- Officials or people on the street will probably not help you.
- If the risk of deportation is high, always take a friend or a supporter with you and do not travel alone. They can check for you outside the immigration office and in the clerk's room to see if the police are there and warn you secretly. 
- If you cannot go to an appointment at an authority, you must cancel it. The best way to do this is to write an email to the authority on the day of the appointment. You should have an important reason (e.g. illness) and send proof (e.g. sick note from the doctor). If you miss an appointment without an excuse, the authorities can report you as a "fugitive" and put you on the wanted list. This means that the police can arrest you anywhere and you can also be taken into custody pending deportation more easily. 
- Appointments with the police themselves (as a witness or accused person) can also be used for deportation. 
- If the police recognise you on the street, they can also take you away. If you are wanted for deportation, the police can arrest you.

If the police arrest you, you have the right to call your lawyer or other supporters.
