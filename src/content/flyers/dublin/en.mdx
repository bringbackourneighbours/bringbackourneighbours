In the beginning of your asylum procedure it will be assessed whether Germany is responsible for examining your asylum application or another European state is responsible. This is called the Dublin regulation.

Unfortunately you cannot decide which state examines your asylum application. This is why it needs to be clarified

- when and where you arrived in the European Union (EU),
- whether you have family members in other member states of the EU,
- whether you already applied for asylum in another member state,
- whether you arrived in Germany with visa from another member state,
- or whether you had your fingerprint taken in another member state.

If Germany considers another EU member state to be responsible for your asylum procedure, your asylum application is “inadmissible” \["unzulässig"\]. It means that you must return to the country responsible so that your asylum application can be examined there.

You have the right to give reasons why you cannot return to this country. Please note the following:

## Asylum application is “unzulässig” ("inadmissible")

- Contact a lawyer or a free advice center as soon as possible. You only have 7 days to file a complaint ("Klage") and an urgent application ("Eilantrag")
- Important aspects that make it easier to find a way for you to stay in Germany are
  - You are unable to travel due to health reasons.
  - The EU country you are supposed to return to has so-called “systemic deficits”. This means that there are not the most basic necessities of life, such as a place to live, a bed or soap.
