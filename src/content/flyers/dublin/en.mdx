In the beginning of your asylum procedure it will be assessed whether Germany is responsible for examining your asylum application or another European state is responsible. This is called the Dublin regulation.

Unfortunately you cannot decide which state examines your asylum application. This is why it needs to be clarified

- when and where you arrived in the ️European Union (EU),
- whether you have family members in other member states of the EU,
- whether you already applied for asylum in another member state,
- whether you arrived in Germany with visa from another member state,
- or whether you had your fingerprint taken in another member state.

If Germany considers another EU member state to be responsible for your asylum procedure, your asylum application is “inadmissible” \["unzulässig"\]. It means that you must return to the country responsible so that your asylum application can be examined there.

You have the right to give reasons why you cannot return to this country. Please note the following:

## Asylum application is “unzulässig” ("inadmissible")

- You only have 7 days to file a complaint ("Klage") and an urgent application ("Eilantrag").
- It does not always make sense to file a complaint ("Klage") or an urgent application ("Eilantrag").
- Germany has 6 months to deport you.
- A complaint ("Klage") or an urgent application ("Eilantrag") can extend this period.
- If you hide and the authorities find out, they can extend the time for your deportation by 1 year. Germany then has 18 months to deport you.

Important aspects that make it easier to find a way for you to stay in Germany are:

- You are unable to travel due to health reasons.
- The EU country you are supposed to return to has so-called “systemic deficits”. This means that there are not the most basic necessities of life, such as a place to live, a bed or soap.

Here you find more information in different languages about the "Dublin-System":

If you hide and the authorities find out, they can extend the time for your deportation by 1 year. Germany then has 18 months to deport you.
The authorities also call hiding "Untertauchen" / "absconding".

You should therefore collect evidence yourself that you are not hiding, but are only absent by chance or for important reasons.

If you miss an appointment with a public authority, you must cancel your appointment in advance. You need an important reason for this. A sick note from your doctor is best. Send the sick note with an email to the immigration office shortly before your appointment.

If the police wanted to pick you up for deportation but couldn't find you, you should prove that you are not hiding. To do this, write to ypur local immigration office and the BAMF (for Dublin deportations) or the Central Immigration Office (for all other deportations) explaining the reason why you were not there. You can write an email or send a fax.

You can find the contact details for your local foreigners authority on their letters or on the Internet. You can find the contact details for the BAMF and the LDS, the Central Foreigners' Registration Office, in our <InternalShortLink identifier="contacts">contacts section</InternalShortLink> .

You should have proof of this:

- Take photos of yourself in your home on different days
- Keep sick notes \[Krankenschein\] or hospitalisation certificates in a safe place
- Keep train tickets, bus tickets, receipts, admission tickets etc. if you are ever in another city. You can also take photos of yourself in these places.
- Perhaps friends or your family can write you a letter confirming that you visited them briefly. They can sign an <InternalShortLink identifier="forms">affidavit</InternalShortLink> to this effect.

Your name should always be clearly legible on the letterbox. You or someone else should empty the letterbox at least once a week.

Your flat door or room in the accommodation should look like you are there regularly.

The neighbours should see that you are regularly at home.
