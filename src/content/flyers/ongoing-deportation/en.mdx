For many, it's a shock: the police have arrived. There may be a lot of police officers and they may also be very unfriendly. They don't understand how bad the situation is for you. They also don't have any interpreters with them. It's often difficult to talk to the police and you don't understand what they want.

Even if it's difficult, try to stay calm. The police officers may also use force, tie you up or separate families if they perceive you as aggressive.

Who is the police officer in charge? Talk to him calmly. The following is particularly important:

- Is a family member not at home? How will the police prevent the family from being separated?
- Is someone ill or pregnant? Is there any evidence of this? Ask the police to call a doctor again to check their ‘fitness to travel’.
- Does anyone in the family have a residence permit or a tolerated stay permit for education or employment? Is an asylum application still open?
- Is someone not feeling well, for example acute panic? Then ask for an emergency doctor to be called.


Try to gather information:

- Are you being deported by bus or, as is usually the case, by plane?
- Which airport are you flying from and when does the flight depart?
- Will you be taken to a police station beforehand?
- What is the destination of the deportation? In which city will you arrive?

The police may take cash from you. You are supposed to use it to pay part of the costs of your deportation yourself. They may also search your belongings for cash.

If you are threatened with deportation, it is best to take your money to a trusted person. They can use it to pay a lawyer or send you the money after your deportation.

The police must give you a receipt when they take something from you. With this receipt, a supporter or a lawyer can check whether the police were authorised to do so.

The police often take away your phone. It's best if you can hide a second phone somewhere. If you can, secretly make audio or video recordings.

Insist that you are allowed to make at least one phone call before they take the phone away:  
Call your trusted person or your lawyer.

If possible, a supporter should come and help you with the deportation. Or they can make other calls for you, such as calling your lawyer.

You can also call acquaintances or friends at your deportation destination so that they can pick you up and organise a place for you to sleep.

You or your supporter should also contact the <InternalShortLink identifier="contacts">Deportation Monitoring Centre</InternalShortLink> .

Inform them about your situation and ask how they can support you.

The police will then take the people to the police station. They are then taken to the airport or onto a bus to be deported. Deportation often takes several hours.

You can use this time:

- Are there new reasons for a **__neuen Asylantrag__**?
- Are there reasons for a <InternalShortLink identifier="Duldung / tolerated stay">/InternalShortLink>
  
Your lawyer or a supporter must fax an application and all evidence to the BAMF (asylum follow-up application) or to the foreigners authority (tolerated stay) as soon as possible. They will need your <InternalShortLink identifier="forms">signature or a power of attorney </InternalShortLink>. It is the best if you have already <InternalShortLink identifier="prepare-deportation">prepared</InternalShortLink> it.
You should also fax this to the regional directorate and the federal police, as these 2 authorities organise the deportation.
Your lawyer or your supporter must always send an urgent application to the competent administrative court.
You should also inform the deportation monitoring centre at the airport that there are outstanding applications and that the Federal Police must wait for a response.
In the case of a follow-up asylum application, the BAMF must send a ‘prognosis decision’ by email (to the Federal Police and the regional directorate); deportation may not take place before this!
Your lawyer or your supporter must therefore make a lot of phone calls to the deportation monitoring centre, the federal police and the state directorate, be available on the phone and pass on positive decisions as quickly as possible.
Sometimes the decision from the administrative court or the BAMF takes longer and the plane has already left. Then the deportation is stopped for the time being.

If you don't see any legal chances, you can also prevent the deportation in another way. But beware: the police often react harshly and violently!

- You can try to run away
- Friends can block the police for you
- You can refuse to sit down on the airplane

Think about what is better for you and your family:

- Survive the deportation as quickly as possible and experience as little violence as possible.
- Or: to gain time to have one last chance to prevent the deportation.
- Please note: If you put up a strong defence and thus prevent deportation, you may be taken into <InternalShortLink identifier="detention">detention pending deportation</InternalShortLink> and separated from your family. <InternalShortLink identifier="detention">Abschiebehaft</InternalShortLink> kommst und von deiner Familie getrennt wirst.

Please report the deportation or the attempt to the deportation monitoring of the SFR e.V:
