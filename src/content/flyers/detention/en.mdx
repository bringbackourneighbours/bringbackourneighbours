If the foreigners authority wants to deport you, they can take you into custody for this.

For a deportation you can be detained for a few days or up to 6 months.

This deportation detention is in Dresden.

Even without having committed a crime, you can be imprisoned.

The police can pick you up at home or at an authority appointment.

Then you will be taken to the court for a hearing.

It is important that lawyers or a trusted person are present at the hearing. You must ask for this at the beginning of the hearing.

In detention pending deportation, you have the right to counseling from lawyers and the contact group for detention pending deportation in Dresden.

You can talk to the social services and request both consultations.

## How big is the risk?

If you have a simple toleration [Duldung], you can be deported and before that you can be detained.

Even if you have been here for many years or have applied for residence, the foreigners authority can deport you and take you into custody beforehand.

The danger is big,

- if deportations have already failed because you were not at home or missed appointments at the foreigners authority.
- if you have applied for asylum in several EU countries.
- if you have resisted deportation.
- if the Immigration Office knows that you have given a false passport or a false name.
- if you have moved away and have not registered with the Immigration Office or the Social Office for several months.
- if you are caught at the border by the Federal Police but do not have a visa and an entry ban or no grounds for asylum
- if you are a man: currently (2024) no women and children are detained in Saxony.
- if you have committed crimes â€“ even though this is not a prerequisite for deportation detention.

If you are arrested, insist that they be informed and come to the court hearing.

## The hearing before the court

You will be brought to the court by the police for a hearing. The hearing is not about your reasons for asylum! It is about whether the court believes you will hide from deportation. Assure the court that you are willing to report regularly and that you will not run away from deportation. If you are not taken into custody, go urgently to a counseling center or to a lawyer.

## In the detention center for deportees...

- You will be examined by a doctor to see if you are healthy enough for detention and deportation. If you are sick and need medication, tell the doctor.
- You can meet with a lawyer, the detention contact group, a psychologist, or a counselor. Talk to social services or an official about this.
