You get a Duldung – a Tolerated Stay Permit – if your application for asylum or other residence has been rejected and you are supposed to leave Germany. It is a bad status. Many rights are denied, for example, you cannot decide for yourself where you live.

But it does not always mean that deportation is acutely imminent. Some people live in Germany for many years with Duldung.

## However, a Duldung causes many problems:

- With a Duldung you are not allowed to re-enter Germany. Therefore, be careful when traveling to other countries.
- A tolerated stay always has a deadline, often 3 or 6 months. But you can also be deported within this period without warning. The danger is great if the Duldung states: "Erlischt unabhängig von der Gültigkeit am Tag der Abschiebung" (“Expires on the day of deportation regardless of validity”) or a similar text.
- If you apply for a residence permit as a tolerated person, you can be deported even if the foreigner’s authority has not yet decided.
- With a Duldung, finding a job or an apartment is more difficult. It is not a passport substitute. So, it is not proof of your identity. That’s why sometimes there can be problems when you want to get a driver’s license or when you want to buy a sim card or open a bank account.

## Passport obligation

If you have a Duldung and have not yet presented a passport, the Immigration Department wants to see the passport. They have many ways to force you, for example, they can give you a work ban or reduce social benefits if you do not get a passport.

You have a so-called “obligation to cooperate, ” meaning you must get a passport and prove your identity.

Here you can find multilingual information about the obligation to cooperate and passport procurement:

If you are trying to obtain a passport, write down exactly what you have done. For example, you can prove that you tried to get papers from your country of origin or that you went to the embassy. Proofs are, for example, letters from the embassy that you were there, tickets to the embassy, or photos in front of the embassy. This way you can show the immigration office that you are trying and cooperating.

In some countries, you can only be deported with a passport. If you give your passport to the immigration office, the risk of deportation increases. At the same time, it is your duty to prove your identity and you need a passport for a residence title.

In many countries, you can be deported without a passport, for example, to Georgia, Pakistan, or Tunisia. Here the risk of deportation with and without a passport is about the same.
