The federal offices decision will be sent to you in writing in a yellow letter. If you have a legal adviser, your lawyer will receive the letters.

If you get a positive answer, you can stay – you will have to do now a lot of other bureaucratic stuff and may need some help from migration counselling offices, but you have a residency for a certain period in Germany.

There are 3 types of refusals:

## Inadmissible - "Unzulässig"

- In the case of Dublin rejections and a second asylum application “Folgeantrag”.
- A rejection as inadmissible means that your reasons for seeking asylum are not thoroughly examined and that Germany does not consider your asylum application necessary.
- You have 7 days to file a complaint ("Klage") and an urgent application ("Eilantrag"). The complaint does not protect you from deportation. You must therefore also submit an urgent application for protection against deportation.

## Simply unfounded - "abgelehnt"

- The decision from the BAMF states: Your asylum application is rejected.
- You have 2 weeks for a legal complaint ("Klage"). This complaint protects you from deportation until a decision is made by the court. That's why you don't need an urgent application ("Eilantrag").

## Manifestly unfounded - "Offensichtlich unbegründet"

- You have 7 days to file a complaint ("Klage") and an urgent application ("Eilantrag"). The complaint does not protect you from deportation. You must therefore also submit an urgent application for protection against deportation.

Go to an advice center or a lawyer as soon as possible and make sure you meet the deadlines. You will also need help with the grounds for your complaint ("Klage") and urgent application ("Eilantrag").

The German asylum system is very complicated, so it is not possible to summarize all the information in a short flyer. Please use the further information in <InternalShortLink identifier="procedure">our flyers</InternalShortLink> to inform yourself and also take advantage of workshops for refugees and volunteers in which the German asylum system is explained, for example:

If you can't get help there, the advice centers will recommend specialised lawyers. You may have to wait a few weeks for an appointment. If you have a deadline for filing a complaint, let us know when you make the appointment. Please take all important documents (e.g. certificates) and any letters you have received from German authorities with you to the appointment. Please inform an advice center of any support you have already received from lawyers or advice centers so that they have all the information they need.
