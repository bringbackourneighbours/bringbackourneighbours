The police may come at night, in which case everything has to happen very quickly. This information can help you in the event of an ongoing deportation and, at best, prevent it:

Have the most important things ready: Medication, documents (children's birth certificates, medical documents, passports, etc.) <br/>
Clarify with a trusted person that you can call them at any time if you are in danger. Write the name and telephone number of this person and your lawyer in a clearly visible place and hang the note next to the door. <br/>
If you are deported, this trusted person can also send you things that you were unable to take with you or have forgotten. <br/>
Do you know many people who could come to you quickly in case of danger and block your deportation? If so, plan together who you will inform. This person can then pass on the information to everyone else (telephone chain). <br/>
Often you will not find enough people to block the deportation. Nevertheless, you can contact individual people so that they come and support you and act as witnesses. <br/>
Do you have proof that you or your family should not be deported? Have it ready so that you can show it quickly. For example, medical reports, court judgements, maternity passports, letters from authorities or lawyers. <br/>
Keep in regular contact with your lawyer and supporters. Make sure that they have the latest documents and information from you that can help you with a stay, e.g. employment contract, medical documents, etc. <br/>

- How exactly did the deportation take place?
- What was your life like in Germany? (Work, school, voluntary work, health, criminal offences...)
- Why did you have to flee? What are you afraid of when you return?
- Do you want to make your name or photos, letters, videos of yourself public or would you rather not?
