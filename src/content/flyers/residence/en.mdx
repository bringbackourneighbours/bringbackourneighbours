- the identity has been clarified, preferably with a passport
- there have been no major criminal offences

<Block identifier="get-legal-advice" />

It is also often helpful if you work, volunteer and know lots of people who are happy to support you. This is called "good integration". 
This is just an initial overview of the opportunities available to you. You don't automatically get a residence permit, you always have to apply for it first and provide plenty of proof. You are only safe once you have received a favourable decision on your application.

## Good integration: § 25a and §25b of the Residence Act

- Residence after 3 years in Germany for people aged between 14 and 27. The most important thing here is that the children go to school and do not have to repeat a class. You must already have a Duldung / tolerated stay permit at least for 1 year.
- Residence after 4 years for adults with children or residence after 6 years for adults if you have no children. The most important thing here is to have a job. 

## Chancen-Aufenthalt / Opportunity Residence: Section 104c of the Residence Act

- You must have been living in Germany since 31 Octobre 2017 or longer and have a Duldung / tolerated stay permit.
- You first receive the residence title and then have to obtain a passport, find work and learn German within 18 months.

## Residence due to work or training

- Duldung / Tolerated stay for training (§ 60c Residence Act) or residence title due to training (§ 16g Residence Act): If you find a vocational or school-based training programme that lasts 2 or 3 years, you can apply for a Duldung / tolerated stay or residence permit. You are then protected from deportation during your training.
- Residence for qualified tolerated persons (§ 19d Residence Act): You can apply for this residence permit after completing training. You must then work in the same field as the training programme. For example: If you are training to become a nursing assistant, you must then also work in the care sector.
- Beschäftigungs-Duldung / Employment toleration: § 60d Residence Act: You must have a toleration for at least 1 year and a job for at least 1 year. You do not need money from the social welfare office. The employment contract is preferably open-ended or valid for at least 1 year. You should be able to speak German A 2.

## Residence because of the family:

- Because you have children or are married to people who have a right of residence in Germany or are German citizens.
- Attention: Sometimes you have to travel back to your country of origin, apply for a visa and come back. In case of children you have to prove that you have the right of custody and that you take care of the upbringing. The immigration authorities can request a genetic test to determine whether the biological paternity is true.
- It is very important that you have the support of a counseling center or lawyers.

## A new asylum application, a so-called follow-up application according to § 71 of the Asylum Act.

- If the situation in your country of origin has changed a lot or you have new evidence why you are in danger there, a follow-up application may make sense.
- But you need the support of a lawyer or a counseling center! Please do not simply go to the BAMF alone and file an application, get advice beforehand.

## Protection from deportation due to serious illness Section 60 (7) of the Residence Act

- If you are very seriously physically or mentally ill, deportation is a great danger to your life.
- That is why you need protection from deportation.
- The immigration authorities believe that you are healthy. You have to prove that you are ill.
- But the immigration authorities do not accept many proofs of your illness. A special medical certificate is required for this. This takes time. Especially in the case of mental illnesses, you must also be aware of long waiting times. It is even more difficult to get treatment if you have a medical treatment certificate \[Kranken-Behandlungs-Schein\] from the social welfare office.
- All in all, it is not easy to provide the necessary evidence of a serious illness to the immigration authorities. If you have it, you must show it to the immigration office within 2 weeks.
- Please show your doctor this information for the special medial certificate to proof your illness to the immigration office:
