Deportation means that people have to leave Germany against their will.

The police collect people for deportation.

Deportations must be announced in a letter. But this letter may have been sent many years ago. It is usually the negative decision from the BAMF. This is the letter in which the asylum application is rejected. The letter also states the country to which you are to be deported.
