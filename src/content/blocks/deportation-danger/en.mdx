- A “Duldung” / Tolerated Stay usually means risk of deportation
- On these Papers it says: “Erlischt unabhängig von der Gültigkeit am Tag der Abschiebung”, which means: “Expires regardless of validity on the day of deportation”
- It is especially dangerous if a Duldung is only valid for 3 months.
- Employment toleration (=Beschäftigungs-Duldung) or training toleration (=Ausbildungs-Duldung) are not a threat.
- Even if you get a “Bescheinigung über den vorübergehenden Aufenthalt”, shortly BÜVA, which means “Certificate of Temporary Residence without permission”, the danger is great. A BÜVA is a DIN A 4 sheet, which you get from the foreigners authority as an “identity paper”, which is often only valid for 1 month and means great danger of deportation. Please visit a counseling center as soon as possible if you get a BÜVA instead of a Duldung.
- You can also be deported if you have appointments at the authorities. If it is an unusual appointment, you should be careful and rather cancel the appointment.
- In Saxony, deportations are mainly to Georgia, Pakistan and Tunisia.
- You can also be deported if you have not handed in your passport.
- Even if you have filed an application for residence, you can be deported before the Immigration Department – Ausländerbehörde – has decided on your application. This can be prevented if you also file an urgent application or request a promise from the state directorate that they do not want to deport you. Lawyers or counseling centers can help with this.
- Even after many years in Germany or if you have a job, are sick or your children go to school, deportation is possible <Block identifier="get-legal-advice" />
- People with a residence title, residence permit during the asylum procedure "Aufenthaltsgestattung", EU citizens with freedom of movement are not at risk.
