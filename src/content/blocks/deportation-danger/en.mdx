In order to prevent deportation, you must first know whether deportation is imminent and how great the risk is:

- A tolerated stay \[Duldung\] usually means risk of deportation.
- These tolerated stays state: ‘Expires on the day of deportation regardless of validity’
- It is particularly dangerous if a \[Duldung\] is only valid for 3 months.
- A tolerated stay for employment \[Beschäftigungsduldung\] or training \[Ausbildungsduldung\] are not dangerous.
- Even if you have a "certificate of temporary residence" \[Bescheinigung über den vorübergehenden Aufenthalt\] = BÜVA, the danger is great. A BÜVA is a DIN A4 sheet with a photo that you receive from the immigration office as an "ID proof", which is often only valid for 1 month and poses a great risk of deportation. Please go to a counselling centre as soon as possible if you receive a BÜVA instead of a \[Duldung\].
- Deportations happen in prison, in camps or at home. Sometimes people are also picked up from their workplace or from hospital.
- You can also be deported during appointments at the authorities. If it is an unusual appointment, you should be careful and preferably cancel the appointment.
- You can also be deported if you have not handed in your passport.
- Even if you have submitted an application for residence, you can be deported before the foreigners authority has decided on your application. You can prevent this if you also submit an urgent application or request a promise from the regional directorate/central foreigners authority that they will not deport you. Lawyers or advice centres can help with this.
- Attention: Families can also be deported separately!
- Deportation is possible even after many years in Germany or if you have a job, are ill or your children go to school.
- People with a residence permit, temporary residence permit, EU citizens with freedom of movement are not at risk.
- Even after many years in Germany or if you have a job, are sick or your children go to school, deportation is possible <Block identifier="get-legal-advice" />
