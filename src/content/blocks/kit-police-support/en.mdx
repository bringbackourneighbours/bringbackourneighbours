The police ring the doorbell and a person who lives with you is threatened with deportation?

Don't open the door! First try to talk to the police over the loudspeaker and find out what they want.<br/>
Caution: The police can also lie and give a reason other than deportation.<br/>
So be careful. To be on the safe side, the person concerned should hide in the room of flatmates and lock the door. You can secretly set up a phone for video or audio recordings.<br/>
It is best to inform friends or a lawyer as soon as possible.
Especially if you are alone in the flat, it is good to have another person on the phone.<br/>
If you can reach your lawyer, she can try to talk to the police.

If the police are outside your home and want to enter, ask them for a search warrant.<br/>
If the police don't have one, they are not allowed to enter if you don't want them to.<br/>
You have to say this clearly but calmly.<br/>
Don't let the police tell you otherwise!<br/>
Article 13 of the German Constitution applies: the police are not allowed to enter your home without a search warrant if you don't want them to.<br/>
Unless there is a sudden threat of danger, for example because the police suspect a crime.You can explain to the police that there is no "imminent danger" [Gefahr in Verzug] and that they are not allowed to enter.

If the police say that they want to deport a person and ask for them, tell them that this person is not there.<br/>
The police will probably still try to enter the flat. They will say that they are only "looking around" [Betreten], but not "searching" [Durchsuchen] the flat.<br/>
Unfortunately, this is a bit complicated legally.<br/>
To avoid escalation, you may have to let the police into the flat, but explain clearly that you do not agree.<br/>
Actually, the police may then only enter the hallway or perhaps look into some rooms, but they are not allowed to actively search for the person they want to deport.

If the police are in a shared flat, the flatmates' rooms should be locked. The police have no access!

Ask for the name of the head of operations. <br/>
Try to remember everything exactly: How many are there? What do they say? What are they doing?

You should accompany the police everywhere.<br/> 
You can show the police the room of the person who is to be deported.They are also only allowed to go into this room.<br/>
Object to any kind of search (for example: opening cupboards, looking under blankets).

When the police have left, you should make a "memory log" and immediately write down everything that happened. You can also record a voice message.<br/>
Talk to a lawyer or a counselling centre about whether you and the other tenants of the flat can make a written objection to the search and sue the police.

## Police outside hospitals and schools?

In rare cases, the police also try to deport someone from a hospital or children from school.<br/>
This is against human rights!<br/>
Hospital staff and teachers must prohibit this and have the right to do so.

Here is more information in german from the Education and Science Trade Union on attempts to deport people from schools:

Deportation attempts from hospitals can be reported on this website. There is also further information on the rights and options of hospital staff.
