If you do not have a valid residence permit in Germany, you are at risk of deportation. This is often the case after a negative decision in the asylum procedure.

After a negative decision in the asylum procedure, many people nevertheless remain in Germany for a long time and receive a tolerated stay (Duldung). Unfortunately, deportation is possible even after a long time in Germany.

Over 200,000 people have a tolerated stay (Duldung) in Germany in 2024. Just over half of these people had previously applied for asylum, which was rejected. The others are, for example, foreign students, workers or tourists whose visa has expired or people who have lost another residence permit.

Tolerated persons are ‘obliged to leave the country’, they theoretically have to leave and can be deported. However, due to many complicated regulations, only just under 50,000 people are actually obliged to leave the country. Less than half of these people are deported each year.
