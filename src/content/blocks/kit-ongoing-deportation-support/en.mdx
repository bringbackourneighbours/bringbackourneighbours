Deportation is traumatic and often cannot be interrupted. It is worth a try.
Counsellors and witnesses are always important.
Try to stay calm.
Concentrate on those affected, what do they need from you right now? Stand by them, but also seek contact with police officers and any doctors present.

You can check legal options that could still stop a deportation:

- Are there new reasons or new evidence for a new asylum application? In case of emergency, you can find a <InternalShortLink identifier="forms">template</InternalShortLink> here. 

- Are there reasons for a tolerated stay / *Duldung* ?

Perhaps all the requirements for a residence permit have actually been met? And the deportation simply came before the decision of the foreigners authority?

Or are there completely new medical reports for an inability to travel? 

Or is a wedding planned and the most important necessary documents have already been obtained? 

Or is the birth of a baby imminent? 

There are many reasons for toleration and obstacles to deportation. In the stress of an ongoing deportation, however, these must already be known and some kind of document is almost always needed as proof of an obstacle to deportation. This is why it is so important to prepare for an impending deportation.

But if you see legal grounds that could prevent deportation, you should try!

Lawyers, yourself or other supporters must fax an application and all evidence to the BAMF (asylum follow-up application) or the foreigners authority (tolerated stay) as quickly as possible. This requires the signature and authorisation of the person concerned. It is best if you have already prepared this.

The application should ideally also be faxed to the regional directorate ("Landesdirektion")and the federal police, as these 2 authorities organise the deportation.

The lawyer, you or other supporters must always send an urgent application to the competent administrative court.

Also inform the deportation monitoring centre at the airport that there are open applications and that the Federal Police must first wait for a response.

In the case of a follow-up asylum application, the BAMF must send a "prognosis decision" by email (to the Federal Police and the regional directorate); deportation may not take place before this!

The lawyer, you or other supporters must therefore make a lot of phone calls to the deportation monitoring centre, the federal police and the state directorate, be available on the phone and pass on positive decisions as quickly as possible.

Sometimes the decision from the administrative court or the BAMF takes longer and the plane has already left. Then the deportation is stopped for the time being.

But you're not so familiar with the laws? There are other ways to help:

You can also collect important information: Who is in charge of the operation, from which airport is the deportation taking place? 

You can tell the police about the obstacles to deportation. You can demand that they are taken seriously. You can request a doctor if the person concerned is seriously ill or is having a panic attack. You can call lawyers and other supporters or secretly make video recordings. 

You are an important witness and support. Be careful not to escalate the situation, but don't let yourself be pushed out if you are needed.

You can also help to pack up important things or look after frightened children - if that is what the person concerned really wants. It is not your job to make the deportation easier for the police!

If possible, you and others can organise a blockade together, in front of the house, the bus, the police station or the airport on a regular scheduled flight. In the case of collective deportations, a very large blockade of an airport gate or an extra area would probably have to be organised. Blockaders face criminal charges, so they run a criminal risk.
local groups e.g. "Rote Hilfe" or "Ermittlungsausschuss" can provide support here.

Try to establish contact with those affected after a deportation has been completed. Perhaps you can help with the most urgent needs? (e.g. money, keeping in touch with lawyers, etc.)

Deportations can also be traumatising for those providing support. Especially if they themselves are threatened with deportation. Unfortunately, many deportations can no longer be stopped. It's not your fault if it doesn't work out. Talk to others about your experiences, it can help.

Because it is very difficult to fight against deportation alone, it is best to have several supporters and good contacts to NGOs, advice centres and the media. So get organised and network!
