This emergency kit is not only for those affected but also for volunteer supporters: Friends, neighbours, teachers, colleagues or other volunteers.
They should be able to recognise the risk of deportation and help with an ongoing deportation.
The emergency kit contains many practical tips, useful contacts and tips for public protest against deportations.
The information is aimed linguistically at those affected, e.g. ‘When is my deportation imminent’ or ‘When you apply for asylum’ - this always addresses people who are personally at risk of deportation.
