There is a lot of practical knowledge in your community - use it! But there are also many false rumours! And every case is different. Employees in the authorities have a lot of decision-making power. What has worked for acquaintances does not necessarily work for you.

If you have a tolerated stay permit (Duldung), check carefully whether you have any options for obtaining a residence permit (Aufenthalts-Titel). You can get support from an advice centre, for example.

The task of the immigration authorities is to deport people with tolerated status. So be careful and don't trust what employees tell you. Ask for written confirmation of everything they say! If you feel unsure, ask supporters to accompany you to the immigration office (Ausländer-Behörde).

Talk little but politely to the employees. Only give them important information with written proof. For example: employment contract, training contract, maternity pass, medical certificate. It is not enough if you tell the employees.

Here you can listen to information in various languages about your rights with the authorities:
