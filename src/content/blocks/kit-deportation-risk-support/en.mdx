As a supporter, there are a variety of specific support options if you are at risk of deportation.
Discuss all options and your role with those affected. Be careful not to intimidate or restrict those affected. Try to inform yourself and those affected sufficiently and then accept their decision.
But also be aware of your resources and be transparent about how, where and to what extent you want to provide support.
