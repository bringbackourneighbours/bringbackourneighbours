You should therefore collect evidence yourself that you are not hiding, but are only absent by chance or for important reasons.

If you miss an appointment with a public authority, you must cancel your appointment in advance. You need an important reason for this. A sick note from your doctor is best. Send the sick note with an email to the immigration office shortly before your appointment.

If the police wanted to pick you up for deportation but couldn't find you, you should prove that you are not hiding. To do this, write to ypur local immigration office and the BAMF (for Dublin deportations) or the Central Immigration Office (for all other deportations) explaining the reason why you were not there. You can write an email or send a fax.

You can find the contact details for your local foreigners authority on their letters or on the Internet. You can find the contact details for the BAMF and the LDS, the Central Foreigners' Registration Office, in our <InternalShortLink identifier="contacts">contacts section</InternalShortLink> .

You should have proof of this:

- Take photos of yourself in your home on different days
- Keep sick notes \[Krankenschein\] or hospitalisation certificates in a safe place
- Keep train tickets, bus tickets, receipts, admission tickets etc. if you are ever in another city. You can also take photos of yourself in these places.
- Perhaps friends or your family can write you a letter confirming that you visited them briefly. They can sign an <InternalShortLink identifier="forms">affidavit</InternalShortLink> to this effect.

Your name should always be clearly legible on the letterbox. You or someone else should empty the letterbox at least once a week.

Your flat door or room in the accommodation should look like you are there regularly.

The neighbours should see that you are regularly at home.
