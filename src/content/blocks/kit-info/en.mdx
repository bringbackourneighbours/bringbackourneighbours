As part of the ‘Bring Back Our Neighbours’ campaign, we, a group of full-time and volunteer activists in the field of asylum and political education in Saxony, have produced several information flyers and this emergency kit against deportations.

The aim is to provide people who fear deportation, voluntary supporters and professionals with a quick overview and further information on the subject of deportations.

The information is primarily for Saxony. Much of it is valid and helpful throughout Germany. However, the contacts to advice centres and authorities are only for Saxony.

We fundamentally reject deportations as inhumane; they symbolise racism and nationalism.

We criticise the violent practice of deportations in Saxony, which endangers people's lives and health.

We want to protect as many people as possible from this violence.

However, there is often a lack of knowledge about what can protect people from deportation.

We want to share this knowledge here  
We have gathered many different experiences of how people have been able to protect themselves and others against deportation. So we can learn from each other.

Immigration authorities ("Ausländerbehörde") and police organise deportations in secret. Unfortunately, we do not know all the important information. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that all tips will always work.

We try to ensure that all information is up-to-date and complete. However, we would be happy to receive further information and criticism from you. What has worked in the past to prevent deportation? Write to: info@bringbackourneighbours.de
