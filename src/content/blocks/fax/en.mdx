A fax (short for telefax, which in turn is short for telefax simile), also known as a telecopy, is the transfer of an image of a paper document onto a piece of paper in the receiving fax machine. The paper document is rasterized into lines and (with newer devices) also into pixels. The transmission channel is the telephone network or radio (e.g. weather fax).
