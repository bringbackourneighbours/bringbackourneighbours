In the case of ongoing deportations, you or your supporters sometimes have to send important applications to courts or authorities as quickly as possible if there is no lawyer.

That's why you have to fax the applications. An email is not enough and a letter is too slow! The applications need the signature of the person who is to be deported.

Some people can fax via their internet router, a PC programme or their telephone contract. But most people don't have one of these. You can register quickly via the provider simple-fax and fax the applications with signature as a PDF for â‚¬0.07/page. However, there are also other providers for online faxing and (chargeable) apps for faxing via smartphone.
