In addition to legal advice, it is very important to organise with other affected people and supporters and to work together to protect yourself from deportation.

Refugees and supporters meet in the ‘We'll come United’ network and fight together for freedom of movement, against racism and deportations. They share many experiences on how to protect themselves from deportation: www.welcome-united.org
