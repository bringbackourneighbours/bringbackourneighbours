You can help a person in the asylum procedure to ensure that they receive all letters safely. Every new address, including a redistribution by the authorities, must be reported to the BAMF. An email with the name, date of birth, old and new address and the BAMF reference number to service@bamf.bund.de is sufficient. You can empty the letterbox if the person is not there. You can remind the person of important appointments and help prepare for the hearing. You can also attend the hearing as a counsellor.
