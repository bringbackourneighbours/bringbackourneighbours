The psychological and physical stress caused by the threat of deportation is very great, often invisible and underestimated. They also manifest themselves, for example, in absent-mindedness, forgotten appointments, withdrawal into private life, suppression of the risk of deportation, apathy or aggression. Please do not judge such behaviour too quickly, but ask if and how you can help.
