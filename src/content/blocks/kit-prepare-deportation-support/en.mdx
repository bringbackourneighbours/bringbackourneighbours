Perhaps you can be this trusted person who can be called in an emergency and who has prepared powers of attorney or urgent applications ready. But don't impose yourself here and only take on this role if you can probably fulfil it. Perhaps you can already organise people who can be reached quickly in an emergency for a blockade.
Preparing for deportation can be extremely stressful, inform those affected about this possibility and offer your support, but do not persuade or pressure them to do so.
