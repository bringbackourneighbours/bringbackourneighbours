You can help with the right to stay in a variety of ways: practise German and improve your language skills, help with studying for the ‘Living in Germany’ orientation course test, find an apprenticeship or job, obtain letters of support (hardship application), help with access to medical treatment or circulate a petition. Advice centres can support you and give you further tips. Help to collect evidence for a right to stay or that deportation is impossible as quickly as possible. This could be, for example: Proof of illness, inability to travel, pregnancy, training place, job, wedding, etc.
