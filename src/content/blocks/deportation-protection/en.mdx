You can hide, and sleep somewhere else. But you should still keep appointments with authorities â€“ or cancel them with good reason, for example because you are sick.

Do you want to know if the police have been to your house when you are not at home? Trusted neighbours can inform you if you talk to them about it. If you live alone, you can also stick a small piece of tedder or a toothpick firmly in the crack of the door when you leave the flat. When you come back, you can then check whether someone has opened the door.

W2eu has written a brochure with important tips on how to prevent deportations:

There is the possibility of soli-asylum. This means that you live with other people, where the police cannot find you. Here you can find more information in different languages:

There is also the possibility of church asylum. This means that you live in a church or a parsonage. The police knows where you are, but they are not allowed to pick you up. Most of the time this is only possible if you are deported to another EU country because of the Dublin regulation. And ideally you already have personal contact with church members or pastors. Here you can find first information:
