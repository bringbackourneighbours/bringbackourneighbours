Find out dates of collective deportations here:

<Address identifier="deportationalarm" />

You can hide, and sleep somewhere else. But you should still keep appointments with authorities â€“ or cancel them with good reason, for example because you are sick.

Multilingual information on resistance against deportations can also be found at No Border Assembly

<ExternalShortLink identifier="noboarderassembly_resistance" />

There is the possibility of soli-asylum. This means that you live with other people, where the police cannot find you. Here you can find more information in different languages:

<ExternalShortLink identifier="citizenasylum" />

There is also the possibility of church asylum. This means that you live in a church or a parsonage. The police knows where you are, but they are not allowed to pick you up. Most of the time this is only possible if you are deported to another EU country because of the Dublin regulation. And ideally you already have personal contact with church members or pastors. Here you can find first information:
